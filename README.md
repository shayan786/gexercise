# Google Exercise

## Design Choices & Process
* Case studies of existing well done photo galleries which included google photos, flikr, facebook, dropbox, & shutterstock
* Majority simply utilize animation through cheap browser resources: opacity (fading) or tranlsation (movement) for obvious performance reasons but also intuitive clean experience.
* The most concerning animation to me was the relationship between selecting or clicking a image from the grid view and conveying to the user that what you clicked is what the detail view will show.
